**Notifications and Integrations**

Currently, supported mechanisms for notifications/integrations are:
*   Email
*   Discord webhook (https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks)
*   Pushover (https://pushover.net/)
*   Custom actions (write your own scripts to do whatever you'd like)
*   Healthcheck monitoring (https://healthchecks.io/)
*   InfluxDB data export (if you already run InfluxDB, you can push connmon data to it and visualize it in Grafana, for example)

There are 4 events which trigger the notifications:
*   On each ping test
*   Ping threshold exceeded
*   Jitter threshold exceeded
*   Line Quality threshold exceeded

**Email configuration**

connmon v3.0.0 marks a move to a standalone email configuration that can be utilised by other scripts. If you have Diversion installed, connmon will detect this and migrate Diversion's config to the new standalone location with is /jffs/addons/amtm/mail
connmon will create links for Diversion to follow the configuration to the above location.
